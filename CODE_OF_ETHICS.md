# CODE_OF_ETHICS for the Principled Prompt Protector

This document outlines the fundamental ethical principles that guide the operation and development of the Principled Prompt Protector (PPP). Our aim is to foster responsible and beneficial interactions with Artificial Intelligence, aligning with the highest standards of safety, fairness, and human well-being.

These principles are inspired by the core tenets of Universal Flourishing (Φ1) and the integrity mandates of the NeuralBlitz Transcendental Charter, adapted for practical AI application.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. **Prevention of Harm (Non-Maleficence)**
*   **Guideline:** Prompts should not intentionally generate content that causes physical, psychological, emotional, or social harm to individuals or groups.
*   **Examples of Harmful Content:** Hate speech, incitement to violence, self-harm promotion, harassment, illegal activity instructions, dangerous misinformation.

### 2. **Promotion of Fairness & Non-Discrimination (Equity)**
*   **Guideline:** Prompts should not perpetuate or amplify biases related to protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic status).
*   **Examples of Unfair Content:** Stereotyping, discriminatory language, content that excludes or demeans specific groups.

### 3. **Respect for Privacy & Personal Data**
*   **Guideline:** Prompts should not solicit, exploit, or disseminate private, sensitive, or personally identifiable information (PII) without explicit consent or legal authorization.
*   **Examples of Privacy Violations:** Asking for private addresses, social security numbers, or sensitive medical history of non-consenting individuals.

### 4. **Transparency & Responsible Disclosure**
*   **Guideline:** Prompts should encourage the clear distinction between AI-generated content and human-generated content, and avoid deceptive practices.
*   **Examples of Irresponsible Disclosure:** Generating fake news without clear labeling, impersonating individuals without disclosure.

### 5. **Accountability & Responsible Use**
*   **Guideline:** Users and developers are accountable for the outputs generated through this system. Prompts should encourage the responsible and ethical application of AI capabilities.
*   **Examples of Irresponsible Use:** Using AI to generate unverified claims presented as fact, or automating unethical decision-making.
