# ethical-ai-gateway-principled-prompt-protector
This project will be an intelligent filter that sits between a user and any large language model (LLM). It will automatically check user prompts for potential ethical concerns before the LLM even processes them. It will also offer suggestions to rephrase prompts to be more aligned with ethical guidelines.
